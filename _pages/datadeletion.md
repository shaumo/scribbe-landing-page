# Data Deletion

Thank you for using Scribbe!

Scribbe is serious about data privacy and safeguarding your data.

If you would like to delete your files from our app, you may go to the Files tab. There you will see a list of all 
audio files you have uploaded to Scribbe. When you select a file, you will be taken to the screen for that file. This
screen contains the summary, notes, transcript, etc. related to this audio file. The top menu (three dots) on this screen 
has a delete option. By choosing this option you can delete the underlying audio file as well as the summary, notes, 
transcript, etc. of this audio file.

Using the above method, you will be able to delete all files uploaded to Scribbe. If in addition to this you would like
to delete your Scribbe account, please email support@scribbe.ai.
